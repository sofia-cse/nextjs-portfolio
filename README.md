This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```
if you don't have pnpm installed, I recommend using corewebpack to activate:

```bash
corewebpack enable pnpm
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Akkurat, a custom font.

This project uses getform to power the contact form. You can register for a free account at getforrm.io and replace the form action with your own URL to set up your form without any extra JS scripts.

This project uses Vercel analytics. To configure analytics you can go to your vercel project dashboard, enable analytics, and instert the provided recorded in your DNS configuration.
